Hi! Iâ€™m Maximilian, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. I'm a mechanical engineer by training with specialization in medical technology / biomedical engineering. Being fascinated by the question of *What is Life?* I decided to dive into Biophysics to understand the physical aspects of the building blocks of life. Researching the field of DNA nanotechnology allowed me to use DNA as a structural building material and create objects in the nanodomain. To study these objects, I build microscopes and employ super-resolution microscopy techniques. During my research, I noticed the increasing demand for computational methods to gather meaningful data. With the growing complexity of my programs, I was amazed to explore the state of the art of Machine Learning and the resulting implications for Artificial Intelligence. For me, many questions regarding the nature of life and what makes us human can be answered when achieving an *Artificial general intelligence*.

Having now found a great workhorse in Python I apply cutting-edge algorithms and statistical methods to bring meaningful insight into data and optimize technology.
